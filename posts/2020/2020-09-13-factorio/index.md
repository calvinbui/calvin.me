I finished Factorio for the first time in just under 50 hours. I waited for the 1.0 release to play it and it was well worth it.

## What is Factorio?

The premise in [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) is: you are an engineer/scientist that has crash landed onto an alien planet. This planet has Earthly natural resources such as trees, water, iron ore, copper, oil and uranium. Your goal is to use these resources to launch a rocket (and leave!).

## How I took a screenshot

At the the middle of my base and ran the console command:

```shell-session
/c game.take_screenshot{resolution = {x = 16384, y = 16384}, zoom = 0.4, show_entity_info = true}
```

This produced a 665.6MB file. GitHub has a 100MB file limit so I had to get it smaller.

To compress that down I converted it to JPEG, a lossy format, to bring it to 146.9MB:

```shell-session
$ magick convert orig.png new.jpg
```

Then following [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeImages) I took it down to `70` quality from the recommended `85` to bring it down to 47.9MB. I didn't find the loss in quality to be noticeable to a quality setting of `80` or `90`, but did see it in `60`.

```shell-session
$ magick new.jpg -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip -quality 70 -interlace JPEG -colorspace sRGB 70.jpg
```

Finally I threw it in [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac)/[FileOptimizer](https://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.io/static.php?page=FileOptimizer) to take another few KBs off it.
[Guetzli](https://github.com/google/guetzli/) couldn't be run on it as the image as it was too large. The image is 268,435,456 pixels so I would've required 80GB of memory (300MB per megapixel) and 80 minutes of CPU (1 minute per megapixel). It is possible to remove this limitation by [removing these lines of code](https://github.com/khavishbhundoo/guetzli/blob/patch-1/guetzli/jpeg_data_reader.cc#L153-L159).

```shell-session
$ guetzli new.jpg new-guetzli.jpg
Image too large
```
