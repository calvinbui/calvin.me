Nothing. You should have zero public DNS entries for a domain purchased for private or internal use.

<!-- more -->

-   Exposes your infrastructure to the outside world.
-   Your **internal DNS** server will handle resolution
-   It's for *private use*. Why does there need to be anything made public?
-   Use subdomains `.internal` if you really want public DNS entries.
