It's been almost 5 days now and the SSL certificate from CloudFlare still hasn't come through. Expected though with [2 million websites to deploy to](https://blog.cloudflare.com/universal-ssl-be-just-a-bit-more-patient/). But the good thing is my account now as an 'SSL issuing' message on it!

I won't be posting anything new in the meantime until it's issued.
