These are all my 3D prints. 3D Printing is the process where a digital design is turned into a solid three-dimensional (3D) physical object by laying a material, such as plastic, layer by layer together. There are a lot of creative and awesome uses for it, just about anything you can think of creating.

## IKEA Mulig Shelf Mods

**Description**: These are hooks for the IKEA Mulig Drying Rack but I repurposed them for my [Mulig shelf](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/40224164/) instead. The shelf comes with only two of these hooks so I printed two more.

The other hook is attached to the screws holding the joints of the shelf together. This does not come by default.

## Dice Tower

**Description**: My board game group are very serious when it comes to legit dice rolls (the dice cannot touch anything when it's rolling). This is our approved dice roller. The only issue I have with it is sometimes the dice don't always come out and sit inside a bit. This would probably be fixed with a bigger slope on the end. Nevertheless, there are a dozen other dice rollers out there.

## Sheriff of Nottingham Stand

**Description**: This is for the board game [Sheriff of Nottingham](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157969/sheriff-nottingham). The stand that comes in the box always falls off the Sheriff. This is a perfect fix!

This is awesome organiser made by [markwal](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1109172) that I reused and only added a small box to separate the male and female survivors.

## Dyson Accessories Holder

**Description**: For some reason, Dyson only provides two slots for accessories when they ship with around ~5. This adapter provides more slots to keep the brushes and nozzles in one place.

## PCI HDD/SSD Mount

**Description**: This adapter allows hard drives to me mounted in PCI slots. I've loaded all the HDD/SSD and 5.25" bays in my server so this is perfect for getting storage in there.

## Headphone Stand End

**Description**: I purchased the [Woo Headphone Stand](http://www.wooaudio.com/products/wahps.html) back in 2011. The stand has two poles which made taking my headphones off it difficult. I removed one pole and designed this to keep the headphones on it without falling off.
