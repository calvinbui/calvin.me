I've updated a lot of my older posts with new information.

1. [Nintendo Switch OLED Modding](/nintendo-switch-oled-modding/) - September 2022:

    - [Updating constantly with new tools](https://github.com/calvinbui/calvin.me/commits/master/posts/2022/2022-09-01-nintendo-switch-oled-modding/index.md).
    - Added an overclocking section.

1. [Worm Farm](/worm-farm/) - September 2023:

    - I'm trying to dry the bin out more and add more paper in my feedings so it absorbs moisture from food. It should keep the worms in the feeding tray instead of chasing the moisture to the bottom tray.
    - I'm also using bubble wrap on top to trap any condensation and stop it from evaporating.
    - I'm adding shredded paper to the bottom bin following this [Vermicompost Learn by Doing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfUzjr107Hw).
    - I tried window screen but the smaller ones still went through.
    - The idea is to lock the moisture in the bin and hopefully, they prefer the feeding tray which should be the most moist.
