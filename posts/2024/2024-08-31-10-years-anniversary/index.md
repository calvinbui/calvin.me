This month marks 10 years since the very first post on this blog.

<!-- more -->

On August 15th 2014, I posted my first ever post on this blog titled [Hello World, Hi I'm Calvin](/hello-world-2/). I posted weekly for 5 months, then fortnightly for 9 months before averaging monthly up until now.

The blog was always meant to be a portfolio, alongside my GitHub repositories. Because of that, I've never had any ads or affiliated links, annoying popups or calls to action anywhere.

Looking back, I always aimed to showcase projects and ideas that weren't already on 200 other sites. I felt I've stuck with that and made each post unique, new and special. I often joke with some people that it required money - servers, cars, electronics, solar electricity and expensive speakers come to mind.

The most visited posts:

1. [Reset ESXi 6 Evaluation License (cron script included)](/reset-esxi-evaluation-license)
1. [Cracking .DMG, .RAR and other passwords on MacOS](/cracking-passwords-on-macos)
1. [Nintendo Switch OLED Modding](/nintendo-switch-oled-modding)
1. [Web Interface for ESXi without vCenter](/web-interface-for-esxi-without-vcenter)
1. [Forward IP Addresses with NGINX Proxy](/forward-ip-addresses-when-using-nginx-proxy)

My favourite posts/projects (in no order):

- [IKEA Bekant Standing Desk Mods](/ikea-bekant-megadesk): My first foray into microcontroller boards.
- [Solar Power](/solar-power): The end-to-end journey of getting solar panels on my house.
- [Designing Taller Sofa Feet](/designing-taller-sofa-feet): Designing and printing taller feet for my couch so our robot vacuum can clean under it.

I'll continue blogging every month until I can't for some reason. See you next month!
