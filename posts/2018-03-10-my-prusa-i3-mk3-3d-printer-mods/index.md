## Other

### [Prusa Maintenance Stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2386065)

## Axis Improvements
*These axis improvements should be fixed on the new R2 parts released by Prusa. https://shop.prusa3d.com/forum/original-prusa-i3-mk3-f30/new-printed-parts-version-r2-b6-t14551.html*

### [Prusa MK3 fixed Z mounts](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2779123)

These straighten up the Z-axis and also allow for easier maintenance. Better all-around.

### [X-axis improvement by RHDreambox](https://shop.prusa3d.com/forum/original-prusa-i3-mk3-f30/fine-tune-your-mk3-x-axis-t13853.html)

Has perfectly aligned my X-axis cables on the pulleys. Provides access to the cables too if required.

### [Y-axis improvement by RHDreambox](https://shop.prusa3d.com/forum/original-prusa-i3-mk3-f30/fine-tune-your-mk3-y-axis-t13851-s40.html?p=65495#p65495)

I am using the GT2 16T pulley variant which has improved the alignment of my cables. It's not perfect but close to it!

## Bonus - TWICE Extruder indicator

As you may already know, I love [TWICE](/facebook-messenger-bot). This indicator rotates as the extruder pushes and pulls filament. It's held on using magnets.
